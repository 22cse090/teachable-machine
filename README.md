# ðŸ¤– AutoML Buddy - Teachable Machine

This is a **Streamlit-based AutoML application** that allows users to upload a dataset (CSV), automatically detect the task type (classification or regression), train a Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance. The trained model can also be saved for future use.

---

## Project Overview
- **AutoML Buddy** is designed for quick experimentation with datasets.
- Automatically detects whether your problem is a **classification** or **regression** task.
- Uses **Random Forest** models for training.
- Provides **real-time performance metrics**:
  - Classification â†’ Accuracy
  - Regression â†’ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Saves the trained model as `trained_model.pkl` for reuse.

## Features

Automatic Task Detection: Determines if the problem is classification or regression.

Random Forest Models: Trains RandomForestClassifier or RandomForestRegressor.

Model Evaluation: Displays Accuracy (for classification) or MSE (for regression).

Model Persistence: Saves trained models for future predictions.

Interactive Web Interface: Powered by Streamlit for easy use without coding.
